Mathematics Final Examination Answer Sheet

SECTION A: SHORT ANSWER QUESTIONS

Question 1:
The derivative of f(x) = 3x^3 + 2x^2 - 5x + 1
f'(x) = 9x^2 + 4x - 5
At x = 2: f'(2) = 9(4) + 4(2) - 5 = 36 + 8 - 5 = 39

Question 2:
∫[0,2] (x^2 + 3x) dx
The antiderivative is (x^3/3) + (3x^2/2)
Evaluating from 0 to 2: (8/3 + 6) - 0 = 8/3 + 6 = 26/3 ≈ 8.67

Question 3:
2x + 3y = 8
x - y = 1

From the second equation: x = y + 1
Substituting into the first: 2(y + 1) + 3y = 8
2y + 2 + 3y = 8
5y = 6
y = 6/5 = 1.2
x = 1 + 1.2 = 2.2

Question 4:
The series Σ(1/n^2) is a p-series with p = 2. Since p > 1, the series converges.

SECTION B: LONG ANSWER QUESTIONS

Question 5: Profit Optimization
Cost: C(x) = 100 + 5x + 0.01x^2
Revenue: R(x) = 50x

(a) Profit = Revenue - Cost
P(x) = 50x - 100 - 5x - 0.01x^2 = 45x - 100 - 0.01x^2

(b) To maximize: P'(x) = 45 - 0.02x = 0
x = 45/0.02 = 2250 units

(c) Maximum profit = 45(2250) - 100 - 0.01(2250)^2
= 101,250 - 100 - 50,625 = 50,525

Question 6: Integration Problem
∫[1,4] (2x^3 - 3x + 5) dx

Antiderivative: F(x) = (2x^4/4) - (3x^2/2) + 5x = (x^4/2) - (3x^2/2) + 5x

F(4) = (256/2) - (3·16/2) + 20 = 128 - 24 + 20 = 124
F(1) = (1/2) - (3/2) + 5 = 0.5 - 1.5 + 5 = 4

∫[1,4] = 124 - 4 = 120

Question 7: Matrix Analysis
A = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]

(a) Eigenvalues:
det(A - λI) = det([[1-λ, 2], [3, 4-λ]]) = (1-λ)(4-λ) - 6
= 4 - λ - 4λ + λ^2 - 6 = λ^2 - 5λ - 2

λ = (5 ± √(25 + 8))/2 = (5 ± √33)/2

(b) For λ1 = (5 + √33)/2 ≈ 5.37:
(A - λ1I)v = 0 gives eigenvector v1
For λ2 = (5 - √33)/2 ≈ -0.37:
(A - λ2I)v = 0 gives eigenvector v2

(c) Since we have 2 distinct eigenvalues for a 2×2 matrix, A is diagonalizable.
