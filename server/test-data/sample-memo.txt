MARKING MEMORANDUM
==================
Mathematics Final Examination - Total: 100 marks

SECTION A: SHORT ANSWER QUESTIONS (40 marks)

Question 1: (10 marks)
Find the derivative of f(x) = 3x^3 + 2x^2 - 5x + 1 and evaluate it at x = 2.

Solution:
f'(x) = 9x^2 + 4x - 5  [5 marks]
f'(2) = 9(4) + 4(2) - 5 = 36 + 8 - 5 = 39  [5 marks]

Question 2: (10 marks)
Evaluate the definite integral: ∫[0,2] (x^2 + 3x) dx

Solution:
Antiderivative: (x^3/3) + (3x^2/2)  [4 marks]
Evaluate at bounds: [(8/3 + 6) - (0)] = 8/3 + 6 = 26/3  [6 marks]

Question 3: (10 marks)
Solve the system of linear equations:
2x + 3y = 8
x - y = 1

Solution:
From second equation: x = 1 + y  [2 marks]
Substitute: 2(1 + y) + 3y = 8  [3 marks]
2 + 2y + 3y = 8
5y = 6
y = 6/5  [3 marks]
x = 1 + 6/5 = 11/5  [2 marks]

Question 4: (10 marks)
Determine whether the series Σ(1/n^2) converges or diverges.

Solution:
This is a p-series with p = 2  [4 marks]
Since p > 1, the series converges  [6 marks]
Actual sum ≈ π^2/6 ≈ 1.645 (bonus knowledge)

SECTION B: LONG ANSWER QUESTIONS (60 marks)

Question 5: (20 marks)
Profit Optimization Problem

Solution:
(a) P(x) = R(x) - C(x) = 50x - (100 + 5x + 0.01x^2) = 45x - 0.01x^2 - 100  [5 marks]

(b) Find maximum:
P'(x) = 45 - 0.02x = 0
x = 2250 units  [8 marks]

(c) P(2250) = 45(2250) - 0.01(2250)^2 - 100 = 101,250 - 50,625 - 100 = 50,525  [7 marks]

Question 6: (20 marks)
Using FTC:
∫[1,4] (2x^3 - 3x + 5) dx = [x^4/2 - 3x^2/2 + 5x] from 1 to 4
= (128 - 24 + 20) - (1/2 - 3/2 + 5)
= 124 - 3 = 121  [10 marks]

Verification using antiderivatives: Confirmed correct  [10 marks]

Question 7: (20 marks)
Matrix Analysis

(a) Characteristic equation: det(A - λI) = 0
(1-λ)(4-λ) - 6 = 0
λ^2 - 5λ - 2 = 0
λ = (5 ± √33)/2  [7 marks]

(b) Eigenvectors found by solving (A - λI)v = 0 for each eigenvalue  [7 marks]

(c) Since we have 2 distinct eigenvalues for a 2×2 matrix, A is diagonalizable  [6 marks]

TOTAL POSSIBLE: 100 marks
