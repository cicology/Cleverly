STUDENT SUBMISSION - TEST_STUDENT_003 (Partial Attempt)
=====================================
Mathematics Final Examination Answer Sheet

SECTION A: SHORT ANSWER QUESTIONS

Question 1:
The derivative of f(x) = 3x^3 + 2x^2 - 5x + 1
f'(x) = 9x^2 + 4x - 5
[PARTIAL - Didn't evaluate at x=2, 5/10 marks]

Question 2:
I don't remember how to do definite integrals.
[NO ATTEMPT]

Question 3:
2x + 3y = 8
x - y = 1

I think x = 2 and y = 1 works? Let me check: 2(2) + 3(1) = 7, not 8.
So that's wrong. I'm not sure how to solve this.
[ATTEMPTED BUT INCORRECT]

Question 4:
[NO ANSWER PROVIDED]

SECTION B: LONG ANSWER QUESTIONS

Question 5: Profit Optimization
Cost: C(x) = 100 + 5x + 0.01x^2
Revenue: R(x) = 50x

(a) Profit = Revenue - Cost
P(x) = 50x - (100 + 5x + 0.01x^2)
[PARTIAL - Set up but didn't simplify]

(b) [NO ATTEMPT]

(c) [NO ATTEMPT]

Question 6: Integration Problem
[NO ATTEMPT]

Question 7: Matrix Analysis
[NO ATTEMPT]
