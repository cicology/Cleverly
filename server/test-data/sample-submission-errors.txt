STUDENT SUBMISSION - TEST_STUDENT_002 (With Errors)
=====================================
Mathematics Final Examination Answer Sheet

SECTION A: SHORT ANSWER QUESTIONS

Question 1:
The derivative of f(x) = 3x^3 + 2x^2 - 5x + 1
f'(x) = 9x^2 + 4x - 5
At x = 2: f'(2) = 9(2) + 4(2) - 5 = 18 + 8 - 5 = 21
[ERROR: Should be 9(4) not 9(2)]

Question 2:
∫[0,2] (x^2 + 3x) dx
The antiderivative is (x^3/3) + 3x
Evaluating from 0 to 2: (8/3 + 6) - 0 = 8/3 + 6 = 8.67
[ERROR: Forgot to integrate 3x properly - should be 3x^2/2]

Question 3:
2x + 3y = 8
x - y = 1

From the second equation: x = y + 1
Substituting into the first: 2(y + 1) + 3y = 8
2y + 2 + 3y = 8
5y = 6
y = 1.2
x = 2.2
[CORRECT]

Question 4:
The series Σ(1/n^2) diverges because the terms don't go to zero fast enough.
[ERROR: This series actually converges (p-series with p=2 > 1)]

SECTION B: LONG ANSWER QUESTIONS

Question 5: Profit Optimization
Cost: C(x) = 100 + 5x + 0.01x^2
Revenue: R(x) = 50x

(a) Profit = Revenue - Cost
P(x) = 50x - 100 - 5x - 0.01x^2 = 45x - 100 - 0.01x^2
[CORRECT]

(b) To maximize: P'(x) = 45 - 0.02x = 0
x = 45/0.02 = 2250 units
[CORRECT]

(c) Maximum profit = 45(2250) - 100 - 0.01(2250)^2
= 101,250 - 100 - 50,625 = 50,525
[CORRECT]

Question 6: Integration Problem
[SKIPPED - Ran out of time]

Question 7: Matrix Analysis
A = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]

(a) Eigenvalues:
I tried to calculate but got confused with the characteristic polynomial.
